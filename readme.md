In this Odin Project lesson I will be putting all of the HTML knowledge from the Foundations Course so far into practice. In this project, the goal is to build a basic recipe website.

The website consists of a main index page which contains links to a few recipes. The website looks pretty bare, but keep in mind I will revisit this project in the future to add some flair with CSS.
