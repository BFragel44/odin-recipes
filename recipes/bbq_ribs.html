  </p>
  <p>
    You'll find the full, simple recipe below, but here's what you can 
    expect when making these BBQ ribs:
  </p>
  <p>
      Boil the Ribs - Bring ribs, spices, and water to a boil and cook until ribs are tender.
  </p>
    
  <p>
      Coat the Ribs With BBQ Sauce - Place the boiled ribs in a baking dish and cover with 
      your favorite barbecue sauce (either store-bought or homemade).
  </p>
  <p>
      Bake the ribs -  covered, until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F.
  </p>
  <p>
      When To Put Barbecue Sauce on Ribs - We like the method this recipe uses, which is to put 
      the barbecue sauce on the ribs after they're boiled, but before they go in the oven. 
      This will allow the ribs to get all the barbecue flavor while the sauce bakes into the ribs.
